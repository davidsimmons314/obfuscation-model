1208350,lexarexasaurus,W,1208350,"i think some of these responses are a little blown out of proportion so i hope i offer you some other perspective besides your marriage downward spiraling or something . your wife is probably not entertaining the idea of cheating on you , and i dont think becca is actively encouraging her to , she just seems like one of those girls who doesnt want to stop being 22. your wife sounds like shes having fun and wants to keep being fit though and might be scared of losing becca and then losing her progress . another thing to consider is that your wife is discovering what its like to be objectively attractive for her first time ( at least in a while ) , and part of dating someone who is very good looking means you have to be secure and trusting enough to accept it . she also gets to enjoy fashion trends and other parts of being a girl that she never got to indulge in before . finding self-esteem like that is an amazing feeling , and it is good for you to be supportive , granted she doesnt totally transform who she is along with it . its also totally normal for you to talk about being jealous or uncomfortable . as an anecdote , for instance , my boyfriend expressed to me that sometimes it was hard not to be jealous about my guy friends . he never asked me to change or anything , but a conversation made him feel better , and its been an non-issue since . i think you are right to have your feelings hurt about beccas comments , but your issues in your marriage have nothing to do with becca . women have friends who are all over the board - party girls , homebodies , promiscuous , or wifed up - and we can all hang out with each other without having any kind of influence on each other like that . so you guys need to talk about what needs to happen in your relationship outside of becca . the point of a romantic relationship is to grow together , including when new interests and friends are picked up . id express that you dont want these new people and interests to wedge your relationship apart . you mention also that you dont like pubbing so much , which could explain why your wife has been disinclined to invite you . she might not think youll enjoy it or like her new friends or be mistaking your interest as distrust towards her . that being said , its still no excuse for you to not even be invited one time , but i think you guys should be able to talk that one out . regarding becca , i would convey that the main issue is that you want to take interest in your wifes life and it sucks her one friend wont warm up to you , and that flat out sucks . id be really disappointed if one of my boyfriends friends just didnt like me because i didnt like sports ( or whatever example ) or have big enough boobs or something , and im sure your wife would feel similarly if it happened to her . you express some interest in going to the gym yourself , so even if you do that alone , maybe you guys could start doing active things together . a lot of relationships go through turbulence when one person switches to an active lifestyle , because so much of your daily routine and habits change . but while you may not be down for pubbing , maybe you can start exploring bike and walking trails together , cooking healthy dinners , whatever else . i think if you are willing to partake in your wifes new interests and she wants to reciprocate , things are salvageable , and maybe you can explore some new territory of your relationship . i hope becca is just immature and not toxic , and that your wife recognizes that - because as you are supposed to be a supportive husband , friends are supposed to support other friends too ( and not ragging on their sos unless there are actual red flags going on ) .

1207911,alzayz,W,1207911,"thanks : ) i aim to please . you say you want him so much -- if he gained 40 pounds or so , would you still feel the same way ? im not asking if you would still have sex with him , or if you would leave him , or if you would still love him ... just , would you still want him * exactly * as much as you do now ? probably not . you would probably lose some attraction to him . that doesnt mean you wouldnt have sex with him , and it certainly doesnt mean you would fall out of love with him . but you would probably lose some attraction to him ... and thats okay . thats the big difference here , between what is acceptable in a relationship when it comes to physical standards . just because he might not be as attracted to you physically as he once was doesnt mean he loves you less . but seriously -- i get what youre saying . it is difficult . and it sounds like you could benefit from just ... telling him this . he might not be as attracted to you as he was before , but he might also not realize how much his lack of attention is hurting you . and realistically , the more in tune you guys are with each other , the easier it will be for you to get back in shape and be happier in general . weight loss/getting back in shape is really a couple effort , even if its just one person . im sure he doesnt want to hurt your feelings by mentioning that youve put on some pounds and he isnt as attracted , but hell probably be supportive if you tell him that youre not happy with your body at the moment ( it sounds like you arent ) and you need some help getting back on track . you mentioned that hes very into fitness and that both of you have overcome weight loss in the past , so recruit him to help you with your journey ! maybe he can help you by making healthy meals , maybe he can help you by carving out gym time in what im sure is a very busy schedule , maybe he can help you by researching workouts and exercises that can help you meet your goals . finally , be realistic about both your weight loss goals and how your body will look once you hit your target . you have twins , and a life , so its likely that your weight loss will be slower than it was back when you were a kid playing sports . that doesnt mean its impossible -- far from it -- just that you shouldnt give up because its taking longer than you remember . it will take longer than you remember , and thats totally fine . also , realize that there are some things weight loss will not change about a post-pregnancy body . things like stretch marks will still be there when you lose the weight . you may have saggy skin . you may not look exactly like you did pre-pregnancy , and thats okay ! it sounds like your husband is a good guy with realistic standards , so thats not going to make a big difference . a guy who wants his wife , and the mother of his children , to have the body of an 18-year-old swimsuit model is an unrealistic douchebag . but it doesnt sound like your husband is that guy , because that guy would have left you long ago .

1192005,homeschooled,W,1192005,"you must have misread what i said . 1 ) i did not say its not possible for someone to be both a beneficiary and a trustee . i said they wouldnt make someone both if they were a * limited * beneficiary . making someone a trustee gives them control of distributing the funds according to the trusts terms , but there isnt someone policing that . the trustee * is * the police . if i create a trust and i dont want cindy ( my trust beneficiary ) to get money until shes 30 , i wouldnt make her a trustee on the trust when shes 21. because technically , she could give herself money before she turned 30 , and the bank would have to let her do it because shes the trustee and has authorization to transact on the trust . that means she could go against the trusts wishes and distribute to herself before was expected . i would only make her a beneficiary , and someone else would be a trustee . 2 ) i didnt say the funds cant be in any bank account , but im saying it wouldnt be in * her * bank account . if she was a beneficiary or a trustee of a trust , the funds would be in the * * trusts * * bank account . which sure , she might have access to that and could log in ! but thats * the trusts * account . if the money was in * her * bank account , as the op stated , that would been she has received a distribution from the trust , and that money is 100 % her money and she has access to it . i work at an investment bank . i know what im talking about . i deal with trusts all day every day . so heres how my logic goes : 1 ) someone says it might be in a trust that she cant touch until shes a certain age 2 ) someone else says no , its in her bank account . 3 ) i pointed out the fact that if she had been logging into a trust account , she would 100 % be a trustee , meaning she can touch the funds before a certain age . if she were a beneficiary , someone who cant touch the funds at a certain age , she wouldnt have the ability to log into the account . so you just misunderstood the point im trying to make .
