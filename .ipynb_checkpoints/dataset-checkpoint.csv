Its because for someone with Downs Syndrome, or some similar disorder, its a word that spit at them by their tormentors--thus when others say it casually, it makes them feel as bad as if it was said with hate. This kind of emotional pain is internalized. Its the same reason nigger is so vitriolic--but with much more history.   People with special needs hear the word retard and it makes them feel like less of a person--for indeed, thats how people treat them. Most people act as if they cant understand, but they do.   The problem is that people use the term as a technical term (as I do here), as a dismissive/hateful term, and as a casual term. You describe the casual aspect--used apathetically. However, the fact that the English language needs some form of technical term to describe someone with special needs, and the fact that there will always be sadistic assholes who will appropriate that term to dehumanize others makes the censorship of a single word kind of a pointless endeavor. As I said before, there will always be a new word as long as the technical is tied with the hateful and the casual.

Man, if this isnt the most relatable thing I [25M] have ever read! Ive absolutely been there with almost every relationship and friendship in my life.

I had proof that she did without her knowing, but I didnt even act on it.  Im so sorry this happened. Ive been in a similar place myself, and it is a very dangerous pattern. When you dont love and respect yourself, you will settle for mistreatment and even abuse because your view of yourself isnt good to begin with. But you should not subject yourself to being treated like dirt. You and your feelings matter, and the way youre treated by others matters, too.   >I just feel like I have no self respect even when I deserve it.  As a final note: You *always* deserve respect—both from yourself and others. Try to remember that respect is not something you earn; its something you are worthy of by simply existing. Keep going to therapy and talk about this to as much depth as you can scratch at. I am seeing a therapist myself and it has helped me learn a lot about myself and self-esteem troubles. The constant reminders at therapy that you matter and that how you feel about things is valid is a big help. Take your time and forgive yourself for when you slip. Its all a process. And feel free to reach out with any questions, because it seems like we share a lot of the same experience and how weve dealt with it before.  Best of luck :)",relationships,False

They will convince you they ate just before they left the house. They will convince you they gained weight, and you cant see it.

1196674,Lufernaal,M,1196674,"Duda, I aint gon act like I know shit, but I have had lots of relationships and my current is the best and 2 times longer than all of the others combined.  For us, I recognize three things that happen that didnt happen with the others, all of them she taught me about.   - Things are not big.  When youre angry, irritated, sad, happy, excited, anxious, disappointed or pretty much anything else, **everything** looks more or less than it actually is. Emotions are great for human ideals of morality and social skills, but for practical situations and problem solving, they are nothing but an obstacle.   So there is one thing that my girl and I have, that she invented actually. We dont talk much when we are *emotional* against each other. If we are debating something and things get heated and go for the 30 minutes break. Its literally something around 30 minutes or more - we dont really count - that we either talk about something or simply do something else. We dont stay still, we distract ourselves. Its kind of automatic, actually.  I thought it was weird first times I tried, that it would jeopardize communication, but here is the thing: **when you are angry, sad, irritated or something like that, youre not actually listening, youre just talking. There is no communication. Its a one sided speech and there is nobody in the audience, except to use your words against one another.**   - Bad things always look bigger than good things.  Someone does something nice for you once, twice, three times, 29 times and then... they do something bad. Boom, there you go, your world is down, they dont love, everything is broke, why me? I wanna die, were done and stuff like that. There is no balance, one little fly gets a whole farm sick. Its like everything good is just something youre supposed to do, and no an indication of care, but any little mistake is an indication of hate.  It isnt. People will always fuck up one way or the other. Mistakes are part of the human nature. **You yourself do stuff that does not make you happy about yourself later**. If you can treat yourself perfectly, why would you expect anyone else to? People will make you angry, specially the ones who are closer to you. You just got learn to let it go.  Stop thinking about it? Impossible? No, it is possible. Get something to do, focus on something else, do some good to someone. Seeing someone smile can help a lot. Get your mind off things. You will notice that the brain works on repetition, **the more you think about something, the more important it looks for you**. If you force yourself not to think about it, by focusing on other things, youll let it go. It may take sometime and it may come back every now and then, but it wont be as much of a big deal.   - love is not about telling shit. Flowers and I love yous are for TV and pop songs. Actual successful relationships are about certainty.   Do you actually feel good about having a relationship with that person? No, its not if they make you happy, a stranger can make you happy accidentally. Hell, your enemy can make you happy, if they want you. **Does he give you something no one else can?** Is he valuable in terms of sharing emotions, financial issues, physical needs and general features of life? This answer is really hard, **most people just want someone that is makes them feel better than when they are lonely**. A lot of people can do that.   You should be with someone that helps you to stay happy, not with someone that makes you happy. If you cant be happy alone, no one will make you happy. Seriously, its not a cheesy line for a blockbuster with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Its just basic mathematics. There is nothing someone can give you more than you can give yourself when it comes to emotions. If you want, literally no one can make you feel anything. You feel things, people can just help you or prevent you from feeling them, but ultimately, your feelings are your shit.  If someone carries your shit, its not a relationship, its slavery. So, just take it easy. Things are not going to blow up if you lay low. Breath, jog, play CoD and take it on the Russians, read a book and curse Oscar Wilde for being so cool. Get something to take you out of this world and you will later see that things werent so bad as you thought when you were drunk with emotions.   Uncontrolled emotions can make you forget things. When youre feeling one thing, sometimes you cant feel other. When you angry, you cant love anyone. Youre just angry. Let it pass. Its like trying to work when youre sick. Youre not going to anything done, and youre going to get everyone mad, because youre bitching about fuck ups that youre responsible for. Go home, come back later. Close your heart for repairs.

When it comes to any dealings with the male gender, I agree with you. However, you cannot fully blame the man for this. I mentioned this in one of my other responses, but you have to understand on a genetic level how both men and women operate. For millions of years evolution molded the male gender to look for the physical attributes in a woman for the higher chance at a successful birth (wider hips for easy birth, big breasts for feeding). These attributes are no longer necessary due to technology and medicine, but evolution has not quite caught up yet. I really am tired of men being treated as pigs because they simply want a pretty girl. We are *hardwired* to want someone aesthetically pleasing. Its like calling a dog obnoxious because he barks.  What really boggles my mind is that so many women treat this as such a recent occurrence. It has been this way since the dawn of our species. If you are an unattractive female, you have a big disadvantage to start. Its sad, but thats how things work. And trust me, I know what its like to fight something you cannot change. I consider myself a fairly handsome guy, with a lot going for him. However, youd be surprised at how many girls wont even steal a second glance at me because Im 55. But this is genetics too. Evolution, millions of years ago, formed in females that they need to look for a man who can protect her offspring. Back then, physical prowess was the *only* thing that mattered to a man. So, of course evolution dictated that women look for men that are tall and muscular, because it aided *survival*.   TL;DR When it comes to the male-female relationship, this is just how it is. Men cannot change what was hardwired into them from millions of years of evolution and genetic coding. I cant change the fact that a tight black dress will kill me on the right woman.

Secret ultimatums are *game playing*.  Dont play games with this shit; if you cant be open you have no business being together.  Second:  You seem to be jumping around a lot.  Like, she tried kissed a guy, and that was okay, but she also kissed a girl, and thats not okay, except shes kissed girls before, and that is okay, except you want a threesome, and she says shes okay with it, but shes not really doing anything, except she said shes okay with you sleeping with other people without her, but youre not okay with that, except you kind of are, but then theres rumours at work, so youre not, and I dont even know any more.  Step back, breathe deep, and focus on the problems you have now, and think about what you can do to solve them.  If you need to keep a snow white appearance at work, threesomes and sex parties may not be for you.  Unless you really really want that life, in which case maybe you should change careers?  People talk; its a fact of life.  You complain about your wife caring about her reputation, but then you freak about yours.  Not only is that hypocritical, but its pretty linked.  If her friends know, their husbands and boyfriends will, and then your colleagues will.  If thats not okay, then keep your sex life between the two of you, in private.  If it is okay, stop freaking out about it.  (Edit:  Also, a lot of this seems more driven by jealousy and maybe revenge, which is super problematic as well.  Thirteen years in, and *now* you want a threesome?  How much of this is your basic sexuality, and how much is you being mad that she doesnt kiss girls in front of you?  Sounds like its mostly the latter, which doesnt sound very mature to me.)  Ultimately, you and your wife need to talk this over honestly, share how you each feel about it, make some concrete plans, break that down into actionable steps, and then review progress regularly.  Dont be all secret squirrel about this.  Have you sat down and told her outright how important it it?  Have you listened to her counter arugments?  Have the two of you *both* agreed that yes, the best course of action is to try initiating a threesome with one of her friends?  Did she say when she was going to do it?  Because it doesnt really seem like she ever knew that this was a plan, and now youre blaming her for not following *your* plan that you didnt share with her.  Thats not cool at all.

1197407,groovyoctopus,W,1197407,"Heres the text of OPs update post, since I suspect it will be removed shortly:  > Original: <link> Well that was fast. Turns out I have a type. She woke up a little before I did and left a bunch of texts and voicemails. I grabbed some breakfast at the hotel, read the comments on the previous post, went over. Im still very torn on how I handled everything; probably should have just broken up with her because, going over there, I wasnt thinking about her as a viable partner or even as an adult. Debbie let me in, showed me to the room that Amanda was in and left without saying anything (shes usually talkative; seemed like a bad sign). I didnt bother to ask where anybody else was, didnt really care at the moment.  > She started crying as soon as she saw me and kept crying very loudly from start to finish. At this point the numbness had set in again. I sort of stuck to the revised gameplan but read some comments from the previous post that made me think winging it would be better. After I told her how hurt and betrayed I felt she started saying that she took an anti-anxiety pill when she started drinking (turns out she drugged herself so now I feel like an asshole for not seeing that) and that she only thought it would make her kind of fucked up, that her memories were fuzzy but she didnt black out and didnt fuck anybody. Im so sorry, I never would have done that sober, (etc., etc.). I skipped over the drinking thing because that seemed like it was going to be more of an issue for therapy and saying You cant drink anymore felt like something I would say to a child more than a partner. I started with, I dont want you to have any more contact with Stacy. The two of you cheated, thats not okay. You cant make me stop seeing her. And I cant be with you if you keep seeing the person you cheated with. After that went on for 2-3 minutes she relented and I asked to see her phone so that I could look at recent texts to make sure this wasnt an ongoing affair. We have an open door policy on technology, we know each others passwords, she didnt seem to care about removing Stacy from her phone until I said I wanted to read their messages which made her freak the fuck out. She started screaming that I dont trust her and I cant invade her privacy like that and if I cant trust her, we cant be together. At that point I said, I dont trust you right now. and started to get up. She grabbed me and started crying even more, handed me her phone, and just stared at her feet.  > Remember how I said I have a type, turns out that type is assholes. She didnt have feelings for Stacy. She cheated on me a month ago with a guy from work that Ive never heard of, texted Stacy, Stacy told her to tell me, she responded that I would break up with her. About three weeks ago she started concocting a plan and trying to rope Stacy into it which Stacy eventually agreed to. She was going to get really drunk and she and Stacy were going to try to seduce me into a threesome and the next morning she would lambast me for fucking her best friend while she was drunk because our rule was that if we wanted to get somebody else involved in our sex life, we had to talk about it. After which, she would forgive me, say she messed up too and fucked the dude from work, and that we can work through it. And I said literally the only thing that was on my mind which was, Holy fuck, youre insane! And she started crying again and I could kind of make out that she said she was trying to fix our relationship and she wanted to make it right. How the fuck an actuary came up with this plan is beyond me. At this point I was fuming and I was starting to want to say hurtful things so I just got up and left, the relationship was unsalvageable at this point.  > Stacy was waiting in the hall and just looks ashamed. Amanda runs up to her and says, You promised me this one thing! and slaps her in the face audibly. I turned around, Stacys crouched on the ground now crying with her hands over her head whimpering, Thats not fair.. Im a quiet guy and I have never raised my voice with Amanda but I was raised by a marine so I know how to get loud when I want to. I shout, Get the fuck off of her! and it put the fear of God in her and she jumped back and stared at me and then started crying again and yelling at Stacy saying, You just had to do this one thing and everything would have been fine. To which I reply, and I swear to God this is exactly how I said it, Haha! Nope! And shout, Will somebody get the fuck up here!. Steve and Debbie came up (I think everybody else was outside and they were waiting nearby). I told them Amanda hit Stacy, keep them apart and dont leave either one alone. I grabbed some stuff I left at the house, called the cops on my way out, texted Adam that Stacy and Amanda plotted to rope me into a guilt threesome, and left; not staying around to watch that shit play out. I also called her brother and her mom to let them know we were breaking up and they should get in contact ASAP to make sure she doesnt hurt herself.  > TL;DR: She cheated on me a month ago, tried to get me to have a threesome with her and Stacy while she was drunk so she could guilt me into forgiving her, Stacy backed out, Amanda go too wasted, tried to keep the plan going, and cheated a second time.

With that said...Im sorry, but you need to realize that your friendship with this woman has changed irrevocably. You and your husband *absolutely must* go low- or no-contact with her, at least for a few months. The reason for this is two-fold. First, you will give her time to ease up on this crush. Second, you will de-escalate the situation by sending a CLEAR message that you & husband are on the same page and that neither of you are interested in her and husband having any sort of improper relationship.   I also want to point out this comment from your post:  > I dont feel like I can set boundaries without getting pushback from my friend; she admits that a part of her would feel defiant of any rule that I or her husband tried to set, but that she might be able to accept a rule set by my husband, who is now in the position of trying to make it clear to her that hes not interested while still preserving a friendship and possibly creative partnership.   Just...really think about this for a second. Is she really your friend here? At all, not just in a best friend sense? Right here, you explicitly say that you dont feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries with her. You say that she *told you to your face* that she will **explicitly disrespect any boundaries YOU set, but not your husband -- thus making the situation about her & your husband, and cutting you out.** This is incredibly manipulative and messed up. She is not being adult about this. Her confession was about her trying to manipulate the situation to sow a seed of potentially ending up with your husband. If she was a good friend, she would have distanced herself and pushed herself to get over this crush.  I CANNOT emphasize this enough. This ENTIRE situation was deliberately engineered by your so-called friend to try and position herself between you and your husband, to exacerbate the difficult situations in your marriage, and to try to manipulate herself into the position of other woman. If you continue to interact with her in the same manner as before, **she will continue to try to ruin your marriage in a manipulative, underhanded manner**. You CANNOT trust her with the details of your relationship, or to be around your husband.  IMO, the right thing to do here is for YOU to message her and say, We [you & husband] need some time to process this. Were not sure we can ever feel comfortable being friends with you and [her husband] the way we were before. Please respect our wishes and refrain from contacting us until we are ready.   Then block her everywhere (EVERYWHERE. FB, email, phone, snapchat, etc) and give you and your husband time to work on your marriage WITHOUT HER INTERFERENCE. This should be the #1 priority for you.

Moving in together should never be for finance expedience or saving money, but only if both people heading into it are fully aware that the living together arrangement is a *trial run* for lifelong marriage.  If you really do see a future with each other, this is what my husband and I did when we moved in together and combined finances.  I was working full-time while he was going to graduate school, so I was making more than him by a fair bit.  We were advised by his parents to have a bank account in each of our own names and start a joint bank account.  The joint bank account would pay for all of the bills, utilities and household items, while our individual accounts would be our own savings and discretionary spending.  We got married less than a year after we moved in together, and the concept of his money and my money blurred away. After he graduated and started working full time, our finances are fully combined.  In your situation, you sound like you are becoming increasingly nervous about the debt that he is accumulating with you.  So you still firmly have the idea of his money vs. your money.  You really need to have some more firm plans for the future before investing more in your boyfriend.  Right now it seems like you are making all the sacrifices financially and even career-wise (taking time off school so you pay for the apartment / your boyfriends debt / his future move after graduate school).  What guarantee do you have that he will stick by you after his graduation?  Sometimes you do have to take a risk and trust your significant other -- I did that with my husband, but we had discussed it extensively before doing so, and we both knew that I was making a huge sacrifice for him.

So may I suggest you get scientific research on your side and show your husband some data to back up your argument.   Recent scientific studies have shown that spanking actually is harmful to children.  We cant link outside sources in this sub so here is a excerpt from a relatively recent article that summarizes the latest study:  > In the Journal of Family Psychology, Dr. Elizabeth Gershoff of The University of Texas at Austin brings together studies of the effects of spanking that included a total of 160,927 children. Our analysis focuses on what most Americans would recognize as spanking and not on potentially abusive behaviors, Gershoff said in a statement. Spanking was defined as an open-handed slap to the buttocks or limbs.  > Gershoff concluded that there is an association between spanking and 13 of the 17 detrimental outcomes they tested for. Most strikingly, she found that it is a very ineffective way to get children to follow parents wishes.  > We found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with more immediate or long-term compliance, which are parents intended outcomes when they discipline their children, Gershoff said.  > On top of this, the traditional line that “it never did me any harm” doesnt stand up very well. Adults who were spanked as a child were more likely to suffer mental health problems and to behave in anti-social ways.  > A UNICEF report found that in most countries, more than 70 percent of children were spanked in the previous month, so it is obviously not the case that spanking is always disastrous (unless you take a very grim view of the state of humanity). However, the evidence Gershoff compiled suggests that the frequency of spanking is as important as whether it happens at all. The more often a child was spanked, the more likely they were to show negative effects.  > The aspect of Gershoffs study that is likely to draw the most disbelief is her comparison with physical abuse. We as a society think of spanking and physical abuse as distinct behaviors, she said. Yet our research shows that spanking is linked with the same negative child outcomes as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree.  > Despite the fact that the studies Gershoff used go back as far as the 1960s, the comparison of spanking to abuse always draws a backlash, even though some psychologists argue they are actually the same thing.

Pigs *can* be trained, if people chose to.    Humans have also relied on dogs as a food choice.  Look at peasant regions in much of south asia.  Look at what is done in times of crisis, such as the sled dog expeditions to the poles.     Pigs are the worst choice for food if you want to eat healthy.  Their high fat content makes them one of the worst choices.   Heart disease is one of the top killers of adult Americans.    Pigs also carry some extremely nasty parasites:  trichonosis, tapeworm <link> Theres a reason why in Old Testament times pigs were believed to be too dirty to eat.

Lets dissect it, shall we?  > After some time the bartendress tells me that my girlfriend slapped this guy she was talking to. As per my understanding, they were having a general debate about religion.  Your girlfriend hit a stranger because of an argument about religion. Really? Really, this is someone you want to spend your life with? She *hit a stranger*. He could have her charged with assault. You cant just hit people because theyre upsetting you. She doesnt get a pass because shes a woman. This isnt a romantic comedy. If a man slapped a woman, he could be arrested. Her reaction to a disagreement with a stranger was to hit him. That alone is a major red flag.  > She attempted to resist, at which point I bundled her into the car. I got into the drivers seat, started it and got out into the drivers seat and pulled out onto the main road when **she started to choke me**. At first I did nothing but croak at her and tell her to stop. When she wouldnt let up, I disentangled her hands from my neck and continued to drive. The **second time she choked me** saw me losing my head completely, at which point I began to hit her. It wasnt just one or two hits. It must have been like ten. She stopped resisting and I drove her home.  Full disclosure, I have been in an abusive relationship. It took him a while to escalate to choking me. Its a big fucking deal. The fact that shes jumping to choking you, *\while you were driving*, is a big deal. **Choking is considered one of, if not the highest form of domestic violence**. Choking is no fucking joke. If you choke someone too hard, you crush their windpipe and you could kill them. Read this. For reference, it takes about 12 pounds of force to fire a gun. It takes 11 pounds of force to choke someone into unconsciousness. If you can fire a gun, you can choke someone to unconsciousness. YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR. You seriously need to see that this is a big deal. I want to shake you right now. This is not to be taken lightly. THIS IS NOT OKAY. It doesnt matter that shes a woman. YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER OVER THIS. I will repeat, **YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER OVER THIS.**  > The guy she was talking to made useless allegations towards her like she should blindly believe the Roman Catholic scriptures and she is not a good person because of this etc. etc. It turns out I misunderstood the entire situation and didnt give her the benefit of the doubt to tell me what happened. I saw her act of slapping someone who she was debating with as behaviour not tolerable in public. I overreacted.  You didnt overreact. The guy could have called her every name in the book, she shouldnt have slapped him. Her behavior is 110% not okay.   > We are still together, unharmed **but bruised on the neck and face** and very much in love and plan to get married in a few years.  Are you kidding me? Seriously? YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER. Lets reverse the genders. If you were a woman and posting here, saying this, people would be flipping the fuck out and telling you to call the police and leave. The advice still stands. You should press charges. You should leave. YOU ARE NOT UNHARMED.  > I am scared because I never thought I had this in me. I am freaked out because I just lost it and hit her so much and this is the worst thing I have ever done in my entire life.  Honestly, I dont think your behavior was completely okay. THAT SAID, I believe you were acting in self defense. You were getting her off of you. You were hitting her to get her off of you. Which didnt even work until you escalated it further. Its not okay, but you are not the monster in this situation.   > Many women, my girlfriend among them have told me that assaulting your loved ones has no point of return and that once is enough to build the cycle.

Their parents dont publicize it 24/7 like the crazy homeschooled families, and the kids end up fine. So it doesnt do much to sway public opinion of the whole thing. The crazy, right wing, helicopter homeschooling parents are the ones who give the whole thing a terrible name.  My mom is not particularly smart, didnt go to college, and homeschooled all 3 of her kids. I was homeschooled for the shortest amount of time (through 6th grade) but my brother was in it through 10th grade. My brother is an executive at Apple, and my sister is an executive at JPMorgan. They both are so, so smart, and we are all very social and easy to get along with. The reason for this is because my mom did it for US.....we had a horrible (and unsafe) school district, and she knew she could do better on her own.  We used the lesson planning that goes into the books. Im sure as a teacher you know how helpful books can be, especially math books! If you really read the beginning of the chapters, and do the practice problems, it teaches you everything you need to know. We all did very, very well and came out as normal balanced kids.  I also dont believe we are the exception to this. We had a group of other people who homeschooled and we all ended up normal.

Like, it will never end and youll be going until you either divorce or die. And then everyone will gang up on him because hes the man. And its going to be a two-against-one emotional beating hell have to endure for the rest of his life.   So one of the best ways of approaching a reluctant partner about getting counseling is to set up in advance some concrete rules that address those fears. Things like:   * He gets to pick the counselor and it has to be someone he feels comfortable talking to.  * You will both commit to going a set number of sessions...somewhere between three and five. At that point, youll talk about it and see whether theres value to doing additional sessions. If he feels like its helping and theres improvement, then you might continue to go. If he feels like his time is wasted, well...he tried. But he has to commit to [x] number of sessions before you pull out.  * You will do your ABSOLUTE BEST not to carry any negativity of resentment into your day-to-day life over the things he reveals. So he can go, be honest, you can work through it in that office, but he can be reassured that when you come home hes not going to spend the next week with you angry and sad.   Then I just like the sales pitch of: Listen, what is it worth to you for us not to have this fight anymore? If the price we have to pay is 600$ and four hours of our lives to find a strategy to work this out, isnt that worth it? Cause weve already spent [x] years being unhappy about this.

Okay first off, the point of dating is to figure out if you and the other person are compatible. Youre never, ever, *ever* obligated to become serious with someone you went on a date with and if they insinuate that you are you better drop them and fast. The only thing youre obligated to do is talk, and perhaps pay your half of the bill.   Its perfectly okay, its completely normal, to not want to see someone again after a date or two or three. Because thats what dates are for so you can figure it out. Dont feel guilty, youre doing nothing wrong. Getting in a relationship with someone you dont like however is wrong as your wasting both your time and the other persons time, and both of your money, on a relationship thats doomed to fail.  So what you need to do is get that idea out of your head that you owe the person youre going on a date with anything. You dont. If you keep up a nice conversation and pay your half of the bill you owe them nothing. You dont owe them another text, a call back, another date, a kiss, sex, anything. You dont need to do anything for them after that first date although a polite rejection would be considered good manners.  Dont be afraid to let people get close, and you can always end things. Your relationships are under your power if you want to end them. Any time you dont want to be in a relationship with someone you hold the power to say no, to say goodbye and to end it. And just keep in mind when you do youre doing them a favor, youre freeing them from a doomed relationship thats taking up time they could be using to find someone who does care for them and will love them and make them happy. By putting off those break up youre hurting them more than you ever could by ending it.  And once more, never let anyone guilt you into anything for any reason. If they do run away as fast as you can because thats a huge red flag.  Good luck, and I promise dating gets easier after youve done it for a few years.",relationships,False

Plenty of people have even worse experiences but dont go on to victimize people who only ever show them a nice time (these women are sharing themselves with you for your pleasure, not attacking you!).  Just because youve been hurt doesnt mean you get to hurt dozens of others in retaliation. It makes no logical sense! These women dont single handedly create the system that you hate and they arent your ex either.   You sound very much like an insane serial murderer if one were to substitute the killing with being an asshole who is likely spreading STDs all through his neighborhood. You have your illogical justifications and overarching anger at society to justify your criminal behavior, but ultimately you are as deranged as any other rapist and your justifications mean jack all.  Your anger is beyond the advice of this website. You desperately need help, possibly even a stint at a mental hospital to work through your demons. You absolutely must stop having sex with women and get tested right away. Its your duty to let these women know if they might be at risk for STDs.   Lets put it this way... If you have AIDS then youre likely spreading it to many partners now. If that alone wont stop you then Ill direct it at your own self interest. If a number of these women wind up having AIDs, report you as a partner and the CDC realized that youve infected far more women than the purported condom use should have allowed then its going to become fairly obvious that youre maliciously spreading it. Thats happened often enough for the patterns and criminal profile of the people who do that to be fairly well understood by law enforcement. You could wind up in jail for this. Considering you believe youre attractive, I bet jail would not be fun for your behind...   If you have a shred of morality left in you, youll call these women up and at least mention that youre worried the condom may have been defective so that they can get tested and not spread STDs to other partners.

I think for women as they get older, the idea of no longer being wanted and desired can become almost crippling at times. Yes, of course you tell her, but women are used to be wanted and pursued almost incessantly when theyre younger. When that starts to wane as you age, it can really take a hit on your self esteem.   What she did is totally unacceptable, but I dont get the impression that she was going to physically cheat. If it had been leading towards that, I think you would have seen more reciprocity on her side rather than her changing the subject when he asked to see her. Not that its okay to do what she did, but I really dont think there were going to be any tangible actions that came as a result of this.   Also - please please please dont have discussions like this in front of your children. I know that your daughter found the messages but that conversation on why it happened really needs to stay between you and your wife. Im not saying to discipline your kids for what they said to her. Of course they feel that way! I just cant help but think that you let them sit there and listen to her cry and explain herself in order to shame her further because you were so furious. Try to keep them out of it from now on as much as possible, for their sakes.   Good luck with this. My two cents - its not worth throwing your marriage away. People make mistakes. Some mistakes are worse than others and this is one of those, but I personally know people that would have taken it a lot farther. She messed up BIG TIME but there was still a line she wouldnt cross.

When I literally called him crying because I scraped the side of my new car in our parking garage and felt like I was a clumsy idiot, he didnt tell me I was being oversensitive.

An FWB is a known entity who you have an understanding with and can trust on several levels.   This would be like asking why someone willingly loans a long time friend $100 but wont loan money to someone new they met who they think is best friend material. They arent actually sure about the new person and sex changes the dynamic in ways that could put someone at risk or make it difficult for them to see the person for who they really are.   Sex can start up all these bonding chemicals but with the FWB you know thats not the case and you also know they mean you no harm. Attachment wont happen and youve already vetted them for red flags. With a new date, though, you might be the kind of person to get too invested and miss red flags if you start having sex too soon.   For all you know, it took months for the person to be willing to have sex with their FWB. Having an FWB doesnt equal being promiscuous and having sex with one person doesnt mean that you owe anyone sex just for spending time getting to know them.   The thought process behind this idea that someone who is sexually active with one person should be willing to be sexually active with another right away is a very dangerous one. We are all allowed to set our own pace with each person, regardless of what else we have going on. Honesty and communication are the keys to make this all an ethical process. ",relationships,False

We shouldnt encourage people to steal their housemates animals.    - Doing this may be a crime in the area where OP lives so its encouraging criminal behavior that could get OP in expensive legal trouble.  - OP is biased as hes in love with this dog. Giving him so much benefit of the doubt that his version of the situation is 100% accurate (so much so that taking an animal against the will of the owner is justified) is ignoring the fact that hes invested in painting a negative picture in order to get support for his version of events.   - We cant know OPs true motivation here. If this dog is getting him YouTube views then hes potentially making money off of it. If that is the case then hes got his own greedy motivation for wanting to take this dog.   So, encouraging him to believe that hes going to be doing the right thing by kidnapping a dog, one that could be worth a decent amount of money if its a purebred, based on his likely biased view of the situation is not acceptable advice to give. That could result in a trip to court, an inappropriate placement of the dog, psychological trauma for the housemate and the dog, and any other number of negative consequences that this brief description by OP cant help us foresee.   People have posted here before about being worried that a housemate might steal a pet that has bonded with them to some degree and, rather than tell those posters to just let the housemate take and rehome the pet since it obviously likes them more, we generally tell them to get it to a place the housemate cant access until the housemate moves and the threat of losing the dog or cat has passed. In this case, we may just be hearing from the housemate in that kind of situation so encouraging them to do the exact thing that we would warn the pet owner to guard against is not right.

1208350,lexarexasaurus,W,1208350,"I think some of these responses are a little blown out of proportion so I hope I offer you some other perspective besides your marriage downward spiraling or something.  Your wife is probably not entertaining the idea of cheating on you, and I dont think Becca is actively encouraging her to, she just seems like one of those girls who doesnt want to stop being 22. Your wife sounds like shes having fun and wants to keep being fit though and might be scared of losing Becca and then losing her progress. Another thing to consider is that your wife is discovering what its like to be objectively attractive for her first time (at least in a while), and part of dating someone who is very good looking means you have to be secure and trusting enough to accept it. She also gets to enjoy fashion trends and other parts of being a girl that she never got to indulge in before. Finding self-esteem like that is an amazing feeling, and it is good for you to be supportive, granted she doesnt totally transform who she is along with it. Its also totally normal for you to talk about being jealous or uncomfortable. As an anecdote, for instance, my boyfriend expressed to me that sometimes it was hard not to be jealous about my guy friends. He never asked me to change or anything, but a conversation made him feel better, and its been an non-issue since.  I think you are right to have your feelings hurt about Beccas comments, but your issues in your marriage have nothing to do with Becca. Women have friends who are all over the board - party girls, homebodies, promiscuous, or wifed up - and we can all hang out with each other without having any kind of influence on each other like that. So you guys need to talk about what needs to happen in your relationship outside of Becca. The point of a romantic relationship is to grow together, including when new interests and friends are picked up. Id express that you dont want these new people and interests to wedge your relationship apart. You mention also that you dont like pubbing so much, which could explain why your wife has been disinclined to invite you. She might not think youll enjoy it or like her new friends or be mistaking your interest as distrust towards her. That being said, its still no excuse for you to not even be invited one time, but I think you guys should be able to talk that one out.  Regarding Becca, I would convey that the main issue is that you want to take interest in your wifes life and it sucks her one friend wont warm up to you, and that flat out sucks. Id be really disappointed if one of my boyfriends friends just didnt like me because I didnt like sports (or whatever example) or have big enough boobs or something, and Im sure your wife would feel similarly if it happened to her.  You express some interest in going to the gym yourself, so even if you do that alone, maybe you guys could start doing active things together. A lot of relationships go through turbulence when one person switches to an active lifestyle, because so much of your daily routine and habits change. But while you may not be down for pubbing, maybe you can start exploring bike and walking trails together, cooking healthy dinners, whatever else. I think if you are willing to partake in your wifes new interests and she wants to reciprocate, things are salvageable, and maybe you can explore some new territory of your relationship. I hope Becca is just immature and not toxic, and that your wife recognizes that - because as you are supposed to be a supportive husband, friends are supposed to support other friends too (and not ragging on their SOs unless there are actual red flags going on).",relationships,False

1201491,OneTwoWee000,W,1201491,"Yeah agreed.  OP should take time to consider if compromise will be enough. Relationships have the best long term potential if you have shared values and shared goals.  He hasnt stated his goals, but his closeness to his family is a value she doesnt share. *Sometimes* only children want the opposite, and embrace SOs with large families and/or desire a large family of their own (my SOs mom was an only child and wanted lots of kids when she was an adult, so hes 1 of 6 siblings!). However, **OP your fiancee doesnt share this outlook.** Shes happy with you and prefer limited contact with your family. She wants you two to be your own independent family unit and the closeness/frequent contact is not what she wants.  This is an issue you will continue fighting on until 1) One of you gives in or 2) the relationship ends.  All things considered, you cannot change another person; you only have control over yourself and your actions. You cannot *make* her love being around your family as much as you do. Realistically, staying with your fiancee means seeing your family on a limited basis -- e.g., giving up your active participation in extended family life.  If you are NOT willing to do that, your other option is ending the relationship and finding a partner who feels the same way about family as you do.

The fact that shes not even trying to work with you to find a solution doesnt speak highly of her, though.  > What do you suggest?  Thats going to depend heavily on your end goal.  If you want her to learn why this is a stupid idea and back off on her own, I suggest talking to her about the very real danger walking w/o your glasses presents. Does she want her event to be the wedding where all everyone remembers is that an ambulance had to be called when the bridesmaid tripped and got a concussion?  Perhaps have her try to walk (or even see) while wearing your glasses (or a spare, should you have one in a similar prescription) so she can see how much worse it is for you.  If you dont care about her figuring out this is stupid, you could go with something along the lines of Ill give it a try but if it becomes a safety issue I will need to put them back on ... then put them on as soon as you have to walk in an unfamiliar area.  If you want to see WTF is going on with her friend, something along the lines of can you give me your friends contact information?  If I can pull this off without it being a safety issue Ill go without, so Id like to talk to her and see how shes planning to accomplish that.  With any luck the friend will say something along the lines of my prescription is barely anything, let me talk to her or yeah I was only planning on leaving them off for the ceremony.

I have been in your boyfriends shoes. Albeit my ex-fiance was not suffering from the loss of a family member. He had lost his job in 2007-2008 and he got into a depressive funk. He lost all ambition and all hope. I hung in there for 1 entire year... 1 year of me support him while he stayed home and played video games. I hung on for that long because I felt that it was his right to be depressed.   But that still didnt change the fact that I was falling out of love with the person hed become. And honestly... I cant help falling out of love with a person who turned from the person I wanted to be with suddenly to the person I didnt want to be with.   And at that point, when we had only been together for 2 years, I felt like I wasnt obligated to try any longer than I did.   If the two of you had been together for a very long time, I feel like this would not have happened the way it did.   The reason being this: when I have been with a person for a long time, I will know who they are. I will have seen them go through things and I will have seen them bounce back to the person I love. So even if they are going through a very rough time, I will know that they still ARE the person I love and I would want to stick around to support them, no matter how long it took.  Your boyfriend and you have not been together for 2 years yet. At the time your father passed, you two have been together for a year. He fell in love with the person you were--and he probably hoped that after your grief eases with time, you would gradually returned to the person he loves. That never happened. And thats no ones fault--if your grief changed you, then it changed you.  But I dont think he should be faulted for falling out of love with the person you are now. I dont see this as him being unsupportive or a jerk... I see this as him making a choice to not be with a person he no longer loved.   Im sorry for your loss.

That might extrapolate into OP thinking she isnt as into their sex as he is -- she might be doing it out of obligation, and there is not love in the sex, like there is for him.  My suggestion would be for OP to have an open conversation with his girlfriend about *their* sex -- how often (if ever) does she have sex with him just to say thanks for dinner (or whatever)? How does she feel when they have sex -- does she approach it nonchalantly, or does she feel emotionally vested in him and their sex?

Please do yourself a favor and dont try to convince yourself that they will; that way lies the path of frustration and exhaustion. * That in mind, it sounds like youre not really equipped to deal with a relationship with a high-maintenance person, and *that is absolutely okay*.  You are not selfish/bad for needing space.  Constant contact works well for some people (your current SO sounds like hes pushed it to near-pathological levels, but Ive known people who would find his behavior at least borderline okay), but youre not one of them and that is okay.  I say this because as women I think we run into the expectation that we *should* be more in-touch/involved/high-maintenance too often due to gender bullshit. * Having in the latter half of my 20s managed to be with two people who were/are completely compatible with me in terms of how much space I want/need (which is a shit-ton, quite frankly, when were not actually in the same room), I want to encourage you that you will find people out there who can handle your contact settings.

1192005,homeschooled,W,1192005,"You must have misread what I said.  1) I did not say its not possible for someone to be both a beneficiary and a trustee. I said they WOULDNT make someone both if they were a *limited* beneficiary. Making someone a trustee gives them control of distributing the funds according to the trusts terms, but there isnt someone policing that. The trustee *is* the police. If I create a trust and I dont want Cindy (my trust beneficiary) to get money until shes 30, I wouldnt make her a trustee on the trust when shes 21. Because technically, she could give herself money before she turned 30, and the bank would have to let her do it because shes the trustee and has authorization to transact on the trust. That means she could go against the trusts wishes and distribute to herself before was expected. I would only make her a beneficiary, and someone else would be a trustee.  2) I didnt say the funds cant be in any bank account, but Im saying it wouldnt be in *her* bank account. If she was a beneficiary or a trustee of a trust, the funds would be in the **trusts** bank account. Which sure, she might have access to that and could log in! But thats *the trusts* account. If the money was in *her* bank account, as the OP stated, that would been she has received a distribution from the trust, and that money is 100% her money and she has access to it.  I work at an investment bank. I know what Im talking about. I deal with trusts all day every day.  So heres how my logic goes:  1) someone says it might be in a trust that she cant touch until shes a certain age  2) Someone else says No, its in her bank account.  3) I pointed out the fact that if she had been logging into a trust account, she would 100% be a trustee, meaning she CAN touch the funds before a certain age. If she were a beneficiary, someone who CANT touch the funds at a certain age, she wouldnt have the ability to log into the account.  So you just misunderstood the point Im trying to make.",relationships,False
